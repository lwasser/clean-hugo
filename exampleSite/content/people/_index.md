## Our Community

This is an example of a people listing page that has different types of members with different roles and titles. 

It is driven by the data in the `data/contributors.yml` file.
So to use this you'd have to have a yml file with that exact format. 

The sorting below uses vanilla Hugo templates and data sorting.
The filtering for the contributor list is dynamic (client-side) and uses Alpine.js. 

The layout is a single page that creates responsive grids.
