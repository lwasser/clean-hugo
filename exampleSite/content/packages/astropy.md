## About Astropy Partnership

The [Astropy Project](https://www.astropy.org) is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages.

pyOpenSci has partnered with Astropy to provide peer review for packages in the Astropy affiliated package ecosystem. These packages have gone through both pyOpenSci's peer review process and meet Astropy's affiliation criteria.

### Benefits of Dual Affiliation

- **Quality Assurance**: Packages are vetted through both pyOpenSci and Astropy review processes
- **Community Support**: Access to both the pyOpenSci and Astropy communities
- **Discoverability**: Listed in both pyOpenSci and Astropy package ecosystems
- **Best Practices**: Follow standards from both organizations

## Package Categories

Astropy-affiliated packages in our ecosystem cover:

- **Stellar Analysis**: Tools for spectroscopy and stellar parameter determination
- **Photometry**: Time-series analysis and light curve modeling
- **Galaxy Research**: Morphology analysis and classification
- **Exoplanet Science**: Detection and characterization tools
