Starting your plant journey can be overwhelming, but with these essential tips, you'll be growing healthy plants in no time!

## Understanding Light Requirements

Different plants need different amounts of light. Here's a quick guide:

- **Bright indirect light**: Most tropical plants thrive here
- **Low light**: Perfect for pothos and snake plants
- **Direct sun**: Succulents and cacti love this

## Watering Wisdom

The most common mistake is overwatering. Remember:

1. Check the soil before watering
2. Ensure pots have drainage holes
3. Water thoroughly, then let dry

## Humidity and Temperature

Most houseplants prefer:
- Temperature: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- Humidity: 40-60%

Consider a humidifier for tropical plants during dry months.

## Fertilizing Schedule

Feed your plants during the growing season (spring and summer):
- Dilute fertilizer to half strength
- Apply every 2-4 weeks
- Reduce or stop in fall/winter

Happy growing! 🌱
